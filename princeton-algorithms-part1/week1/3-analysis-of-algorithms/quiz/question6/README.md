# Egg drop

Suppose that you have an n-story building (with floors 1 through n) and plenty of eggs. An egg breaks if it is dropped from floor T or higher and does not break otherwise. Your goal is to devise a strategy to determine the value of T given the following limitations on the number of eggs and tosses:

Version 0: 1 egg, ≤ T tosses.
Version 1: ~lg(n) eggs and ∼lg(n) tosses.
Version 2: ∼lg(T) eggs and 2.lg(T) tosses.
Version 3: 2 eggs and ~2.sqrt(n) tosses.
Version 4: 2 eggs and ≤ c.sqrt(T) tossed for some fixed constant c.
