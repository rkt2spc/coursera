# Universal Hash Function

Any hash function is vulnerable to a certain pathological data set that I'll make it more prone to collisions.

We can randomly choose a hash function at runtime to somewhat avoid pathological data sets.

A set of hash functions is considered universal if on average a hash function within it is uniform.
