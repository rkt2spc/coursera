# Greedy Algorithm

**Definition:** This type of algorithm iteratively makes seemingly "best" decisions at each step and hoping that this sequence of "best" decisions will give the best result.

**Attributes:**

- Easy to propose multiple greedy algorithms for many problems.
- Easy running time analysis.
- Hard to establish correctness.
